('Herbie Hancock', 'Man-Child', 1974, 'Jazz', 'MAN-CHILD.jpg', 'Columbia Records', 'Man-Child is the seventeenth album by Herbie Hancock. The album is arguably one of his most funk influenced albums and it represents his further departure from the "spacey, higher atmosphere jazz," as he referred to it, of his earlier career. Hancock uses more funk based rhythms around the hi-hat, and snare drum. The tracks are characterized by short, repeated riffs by both the rhythm section, horns accompaniment, and bass lines. Man-Child features less improvisation from the whole band and more concentrated grooves with brief solos from the horns and Hancock himself on synthesizer and Fender Rhodes pianoover-top of the repeated riffs. This album features the addition of electric guitar to his new sound, which he started only five years prior to this album with Fat Albert Rotunda. The guitarists featured on this album were Melvin "Wah Wah Watson" Rogin, Duane "Blackbird" McKnight and David T. Walker. Their extensive use of wah-wah pedal and accenting chords on the up-beat rather than the down-beat is what helps to give the album a distinct and funkier rhythm that is broken up by brief periods of stop-time where only the sustained chords are heard from the electric guitar with an open wah pedal. Furthermore the riffs are fast-paced and energetic with repeating patterns that combine with multiple voices (i.e. horns, piano, bass, synthesizer, guitar, brief vocal patterns from Stevie Wonder and Herbie Hancock, and drums/percussion). The horns section in "Hang Up Your Hang-Ups" plays repeated riffs in unison that are alternating answered by electric piano, synthesizer, and electric guitar in brief periods of call and response.\r\n', '', 30),

('Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers', 'Moanin''', 1958, 'Jazz', 'Moanin_Art_Blakey.jpg', 'Blue Note', 'This was Blakey''s first album for Blue Note in several years, after a period of recording for a miscellany of labels, and marked both a homecoming and a fresh start. Originally the LP was self-titled, but the instant popularity of the funky opening track "Moanin''" (by pianist Bobby Timmons) led to its becoming known by that title.', '', 33),
