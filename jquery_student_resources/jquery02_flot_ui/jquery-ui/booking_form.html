		<p>A lot of us are happily trading the Great White North for the great white sand of places like Varadero, Punta Cana, Mexico.s Mayan Riviera, Hawaii and Florida. Some of us are taking off to cruise the Caribbean and visit ports of call in sunny places like the Cayman Islands, Jamaica and Barbados.</p>
		<p>Others are tasting the Latin flavours of destinations like Costa Rica, Honduras and Margarita Island, Venezuela, or the history of Cartagena, the fortress town that once guarded treasure-laden Spanish galleons against the likes of Sir Francis Drake and Henry Morgan. Mind you, modern-day treasure hunters are more likely heading for the bright lights and sensational entertainment of Las Vegas and its casinos.</p>
